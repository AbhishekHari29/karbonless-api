# Karbonless-API

## Description

This is a RESTful API for Karbonless app that helps users to keep track of the carbon footprint generated by them. The idea behind the Karbonless is to develop a mobile application that gives the users incentives to reduce their carbon footprint. The application takes some user input like food consumed, mode of travel, etc to calculate the carbon emitted by the userâ€™s activity. The users can be given a daily carbon emission quota and can be rewarded if they manage to stay within the limit.
